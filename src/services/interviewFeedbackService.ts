  "suggestions": [<array of specific actionable suggestions to improve the answer>],
  "tone_confidence_rating": "<one of: Confident, Somewhat Confident, Nervous, Very Nervous, Professional>",
  "strengths": [<array of things the candidate did well>],
  "improvement_areas": [<array of areas needing improvement>]
}

SCORING CRITERIA:
- 9-10: Excellent answer with deep understanding, clear explanation, and relevant examples
- 7-8: Good answer covering main concepts with minor gaps
- 5-6: Satisfactory answer with significant gaps or unclear explanations
- 3-4: Poor answer missing key concepts or containing inaccuracies
- 0-2: Very poor answer showing fundamental misunderstanding

Be constructive, specific, and encouraging in your feedback. Focus on both what was done well and what could be improved.`;
